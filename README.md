Overview
In this repository, you will find detailed documentation, schematics, datasheets, and other resources related to the power subsystem of our project. The power subsystem is responsible for managing the electrical power distribution, charging, regulation, and protection within the system.

Folder Structure
/Documentation: Contains detailed documentation related to the power subsystem, including design decisions, failure management strategies, and performance analysis.
/Schematics: Stores all the schematic diagrams of the power subsystem, including PCB layouts, circuit diagrams, and block diagrams.
/Datasheets: Houses datasheets for all the components used in the power subsystem. These datasheets provide detailed specifications and information about each component.
/BOM: Contains the Bill of Materials (BOM) for the power subsystem. The BOM lists all the components required for the power subsystem, along with their quantities and references.
Datasheets
The Datasheets folder contains datasheets for all the components used in the power subsystem. These datasheets are essential references for understanding the specifications, characteristics, and application notes of each component.

Schematics
The Schematics folder contains detailed schematic diagrams of the power subsystem. These schematics include PCB layouts, circuit diagrams, and block diagrams, providing a comprehensive view of the power management system's architecture and design.

Bill of Materials (BOM)
The Bill of Materials (BOM) folder contains a list of all the components required for the power subsystem. The BOM includes part numbers, descriptions, quantities, and references to help procure the necessary components for building the power management system.
